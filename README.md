Welcome to **Audio Visualization**, the ultimate audio visualization app that brings your music to life with captivating visuals. Enhance your listening experience by seeing the volume levels of each Hertz channel in real-time.

## Requirements

It uses a XAMPP server to run, because it needs to use PHP.

## Features:

**Real-Time Visualization:** Watch as your music transforms into visuals in real-time. Our app analyzes the audio's frequency and amplitude to generate bars that represent the volume of each Hertz channel, with heights ranging from 0% to 100%. The bars are color-coded (green, yellow, or red) to indicate the volume level of each channel.

## How to Use

1. Download the zip file from GitHub.
2. Unzip it.
3. Place the unzipped folder in the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
4. Start the Apache server in XAMPP.
5. Access your localhost (usually `127.0.0.1`).
6. Navigate through your browser to the folder.
7. Open the app.
8. Upload a music file and click on save.
9. Select the music on the sidebar menu to start visualizing.
